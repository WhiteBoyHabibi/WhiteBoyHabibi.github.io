## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 2, Part 1


  * This lab was joyful because it was the first time I officially coded. It was very memorable because we did math and multiplication. With multiplication we put in a message which was very simple but memorable. It's why Lab 2 is one of my favorites because it will forever be in my heart.


* Lab 6, Part 1


  * This lab was fun because we learned how to use different options and strings. It was a fun lab because the different strings we had we could make as many options as we wanted. It also reminded me how good a sandwich would be. Once I figured out how to use strings I could use it for many different labs.


* Lab 7, Part 1


  * This lab was challenging but fun because I learned how to make a calendar. Making a calendar I learned how to use the function difference to add time to a date. It was very challenging but once I got the hang of it It was one of my favorites.
